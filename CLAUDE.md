## Loan System

### 7-Point Eligibility Tests (Centralized Logic)
1. ✅ **Account not blocked** (`is_blocked = 0`)
2. ✅ **Joining fee approved** (`joining_fee_approved = 'approved'`)  
3. ✅ **Minimum balance (500 KWD)** (`balance >= 500`)
4. ✅ **One year registration** (`registration_date <= 1 year ago`)
5. ✅ **No active loans** (no `requested_loan` with `status = 'approved'` and `total_paid < loan_amount`)
6. ✅ **Subscription payments (240 KWD minimum within 24 months)** (from `transaction` table)
7. ✅ **30 days since last loan closure** (`loan_closed_date` check with countdown display)

### Loan Calculation (Modularized)
- **Installment Formula**: `I = 0.006667 × (L² / B)` (rounded to nearest 5 KWD)
- **Period Calculation**: `Math.ceil(L / I)` with 6-month minimum (dynamic, no hardcoded duration)
- **Total Repayment**: Exactly equals loan amount (adjusted final payment, no interest/fees)
- **Maximum Loan**: Lesser of `balance × 3` or `10,000 KWD`
- **Minimum Installment**: 20 KWD (except final payment)
- **Payment Structure**: No processing fees - users pay only the loan amount
- **Centralized Logic**: All calculations use `LoanCalculator` model for consistency

### Loan Status Logic (Unified)
- **Active Loans**: `status = 'approved'` AND `total_paid < loan_amount`
- **Completed Loans**: `status = 'approved'` AND `total_paid >= loan_amount`
- **Status Consistency**: Both user and admin views use `LoanStatusHelper` for uniform status detection
- **Auto-Closure**: Loans automatically get `loan_closed_date` when fully paid (status remains 'approved')

### Payment System
- **User Interface**: Single modern form with progress tracking and credit history
- **Credit History**: Collapsible section showing all previous payments with status
- **Admin Approval**: Required for all loan payments
- **Exact Repayment**: Final installment adjusted to prevent overpayment
- **Real-time Validation**: Enforces minimum amounts with smart final payment handling
- **Payment Tracking**: Individual payment records with admin approver info
- **Completion Logic**: Payments tab shows completion message when no active loans

- **ApiHelper**: Unified API management (optional - maintains backward compatibility)
- **Shared Utilities**: Reduce code duplication and ensure consistency

### Loan Calculation Logic
```javascript
// Uses centralized LoanCalculator class
const calculator = new LoanCalculator();
const installmentData = calculator.calculateInstallment(loanAmount, userBalance);
const monthlyInstallment = installmentData.amount;

// Period calculation  
const period = Math.max(Math.ceil(loanAmount / monthlyInstallment), 6);

// Final payment adjustment (handled automatically)
const wholePeriods = Math.floor(loanAmount / monthlyInstallment);
const finalPayment = loanAmount - (wholePeriods * monthlyInstallment);
```

### Database Operations
- **Loan Payments**: Use `loan_id` as primary key for payment approvals
- **Status Updates**: 'pending' → 'accepted'/'rejected' by admin
- **Eligibility Checks**: Single unified method with individual test results
- **30-Day Tracking**: Proper `loan_closed_date` checking with day countdown
- **Column Consistency**: All queries use correct `credit` column (not `amount`)
- **Smart Auto-Closure**: Loans marked as closed when `total_paid >= loan_amount`
- **Completion Logic**: Fixed auto-closure to only set `loan_closed_date`, not change status

## Future Enhancement: Family Account Delegation System 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

### Concept
Allow family members (fathers) to manage payments and transactions for other family members (sons, wives) while maintaining individual account autonomy.

### Proposed Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE account_delegations (
    delegation_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    delegator_user_id INT,  -- Person granting access (son/wife)
    delegate_user_id INT,   -- Person receiving access (father)
    delegation_type ENUM('view_only', 'payments_only', 'full_access') DEFAULT 'payments_only',
    permissions JSON,       -- {"loan_payments": true, "subscriptions": true, "view_balance": true}
    status ENUM('pending', 'active', 'revoked') DEFAULT 'pending',
    created_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    approved_date TIMESTAMP NULL,
    revoked_date TIMESTAMP NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (delegator_user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (delegate_user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id),
    UNIQUE KEY unique_delegation (delegator_user_id, delegate_user_id)
);
```

### Key Features
- **Delegation Request System**: Send/approve delegation requests between family members
