**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Authentication test validates complete workflow
const authResponse = await this.apiRequest('POST', '/auth/login', {
  userId: testUser.user_id,
  password: 'test123'
});
this.assert(authResponse.status === 200, 'Valid login succeeded');
this.assert(!!authResponse.data.data.token, 'JWT token returned');
```

- **✅ Admin Approval Workflow**: Prevent duplicate approvals, status tracking
- **✅ Payment Processing**: Installment validation and balance updates
- **✅ Loan Status Tracking**: Active, completed, overdue detection

**Business Rules Verified:**
```javascript
✅ No active/pending loans
✅ 1-year registration requirement  
✅ 30-day waiting period after loan closure
✅ Minimum 500 KWD balance requirement
✅ 240 KWD subscription payment (24 months)
